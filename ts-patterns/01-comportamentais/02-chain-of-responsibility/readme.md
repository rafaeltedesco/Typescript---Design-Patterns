# Chain Of Responsibility
---

`Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.` [Desing Patterns Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility)
